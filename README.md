# OpenCV-Face-Recognition

Open the ML .py file. I suggest you use pycharm, also dont forget to add the xml(s) files to the path. I have given 4 xml(s) files which you can use according to you.
Don't forget to download the opencv library. If you want to use external camera(s) just change the camera variable.
